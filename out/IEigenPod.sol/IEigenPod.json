(See https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7002#fee-update-rule for details)Note on beacon chain behavior: - Withdrawal requests have two types: full exit requests, and partial exit requests.   Partial exit requests will be skipped if the validator has 0x01 withdrawal credentials.   If you want your validators to have access to partial exits, use `requestConsolidation`   to change their withdrawal credentials to compounding (0x02). - If request.amount == 0, this is a FULL exit request. A full exit request initiates a   standard validator exit. - Other amounts are treated as PARTIAL exit requests. A partial exit request will NOT result   in a validator with less than 32 ETH balance. Any requested amount above this is ignored. - The actual amount withdrawn for a partial exit is given by the formula:   min(request.amount, state.balances[vIdx] - 32 ETH - pending_balance_to_withdraw)   (where `pending_balance_to_withdraw` is the sum of any outstanding partial exit requests)   (Note that this means you may request more than is actually withdrawn!)Note that withdrawal requests CAN FAIL for a variety of reasons.

While a change from nonzero to zero DOES guarantee that a validator has been fully exited, it is possible that the magnitude of this change does not capture what is typically thought of as a \\\"full exit.\\\" For example: 1. Consider a validator was last checkpointed at 32 ETH before exiting. Once the exit has been processed, it is expected that the validator's exited balance is calculated to be `32 ETH`. 2. However, before `startCheckpoint` is called, a deposit is made to the validator for 1 ETH. The beacon chain will automatically withdraw this ETH, but not until the withdrawal sweep passes over the validator again. Until this occurs, the validator's current balance (used for checkpointing) is 1 ETH. 3. If `startCheckpoint` is called at this point, the balance delta calculated for this validator will be `-31 ETH`, and because the validator has a nonzero balance, it is not marked WITHDRAWN. 4. After the exit is processed by the beacon chain, a subsequent `startCheckpoint` and checkpoint proof will calculate a balance delta of `-1 ETH` and attribute a 1 ETH exit to the validator. If this edge case impacts your usecase, it should be possible to mitigate this by monitoring for deposits to your exited validators, and waiting to call `startCheckpoint` until those deposits have been automatically exited. Additional edge cases this mapping does not cover: - If a validator is slashed, their balance exited will reflect their original balance rather than the slashed amount - The final partial withdrawal for an exited validator will be likely be included in this mapping.   i.e. if a validator was last checkpointed at 32.1 ETH before exiting, the next checkpoint will calculate their   \\\"exited\\\" amount to be 32.1 ETH rather than 32 ETH.\"},\"currentCheckpoint()\":{\"notice\":\"Returns the currently-active checkpoint If there's not an active checkpoint, this method returns the checkpoint that was last active.\"},\"currentCheckpointTimestamp()\":{\"notice\":\"The timestamp of the currently-active checkpoint.

(See https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7002#fee-update-rule for details)Note on beacon chain behavior: - Withdrawal requests have two types: full exit requests, and partial exit requests.   Partial exit requests will be skipped if the validator has 0x01 withdrawal credentials.   If you want your validators to have access to partial exits, use `requestConsolidation`   to change their withdrawal credentials to compounding (0x02). - If request.amount == 0, this is a FULL exit request. A full exit request initiates a   standard validator exit. - Other amounts are treated as PARTIAL exit requests. A partial exit request will NOT result   in a validator with less than 32 ETH balance. Any requested amount above this is ignored. - The actual amount withdrawn for a partial exit is given by the formula:   min(request.amount, state.balances[vIdx] - 32 ETH - pending_balance_to_withdraw)   (where `pending_balance_to_withdraw` is the sum of any outstanding partial exit requests)   (Note that this means you may request more than is actually withdrawn!)Note that withdrawal requests CAN FAIL for a variety of reasons.

While a change from nonzero to zero DOES guarantee that a validator has been fully exited, it is possible that the magnitude of this change does not capture what is typically thought of as a \"full exit.\" For example: 1. Consider a validator was last checkpointed at 32 ETH before exiting. Once the exit has been processed, it is expected that the validator's exited balance is calculated to be `32 ETH`. 2. However, before `startCheckpoint` is called, a deposit is made to the validator for 1 ETH. The beacon chain will automatically withdraw this ETH, but not until the withdrawal sweep passes over the validator again. Until this occurs, the validator's current balance (used for checkpointing) is 1 ETH. 3. If `startCheckpoint` is called at this point, the balance delta calculated for this validator will be `-31 ETH`, and because the validator has a nonzero balance, it is not marked WITHDRAWN. 4. After the exit is processed by the beacon chain, a subsequent `startCheckpoint` and checkpoint proof will calculate a balance delta of `-1 ETH` and attribute a 1 ETH exit to the validator. If this edge case impacts your usecase, it should be possible to mitigate this by monitoring for deposits to your exited validators, and waiting to call `startCheckpoint` until those deposits have been automatically exited. Additional edge cases this mapping does not cover: - If a validator is slashed, their balance exited will reflect their original balance rather than the slashed amount - The final partial withdrawal for an exited validator will be likely be included in this mapping.   i.e. if a validator was last checkpointed at 32.1 ETH before exiting, the next checkpoint will calculate their   \"exited\" amount to be 32.1 ETH rather than 32 ETH."},"currentCheckpoint()":{"notice":"Returns the currently-active checkpoint If there's not an active checkpoint, this method returns the checkpoint that was last active."},"currentCheckpointTimestamp()":{"notice":"The timestamp of the currently-active checkpoint.
